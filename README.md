**Estimating phylogenetic trees from (smart-seq2) scRNA-seq data.**

In this repository, we provide our recommended pipeline for performing single-cell phylogenetic analysis using scRNA-seq data. Our workflow includes:

- FASTQ Mapping and BAM Processing
- Variant calling + Genotyping
- Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction (with bootstrap support estimation)
- Read Count Normalization
- Phylogenetic Signal Estimation

For further details on the methodology and its application, please refer to our publication:
